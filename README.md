Battleship
==========

This is my very first Python program and my very first GitHub repository. Purpose of doing this is to learn the Python, the Github, improve my English and prepare myself to writing some difficult and beautiful code. For now my Battleship is extremely simple version of Battleship game, which generates random one-dot boat on 5x5 board, prints it in purpose of debug, and lets you to try your luck shooting 5 times.

Plans for the Future
====================

My final purpose in this repository is to create a PvP/PvE game, very similar to Battleship but with some extended rules which I going to create after implementation all basic rules and clean up my code. I will be glad if the community will help me to test and clean up code, and I will be not very glad if someone tries to write larg bunch of logic (actually I want to enjoy it mysels this time) 

Special Thanks
==============

I want to thank www.codecademy.com that gave me a very convenient and free way to learn Python and other script languages. If you are reading this, I extremely propose you to try this link and finally make the similar repository. Our world requires scientists and programmers, not politics and warriors.
